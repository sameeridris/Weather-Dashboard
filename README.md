## Installation

The user needs to clone the repository to their local machine, navigate to the project directory, and install the dependencies.

## Usage

The user will be able to see the weather outlook for multiple cities in case they want to plan a trip or just plan the week out in their own city. They'll be able to see current and future conditions in that city and be able to save and delete the city they're looking into.

## How to Contribute

Other people could add functionality that allows the user to check these weathers in different times of each day as well as in different timezones as I have set the time zone to Central Time.
